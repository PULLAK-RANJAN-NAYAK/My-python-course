# There are various methods for tuple

a = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0)
print(a.count(5)) # as the count word suggest it is going to count the certain value given and gives how many times it is repeated

b = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0,5,5,5,5)
print(b.index(5)) # # as the index word suggest it is going to give the index of the certain value given
