I was the old file named rename_old.txt and the contents are being copied in the new file 
renmae_new

So the best way is to first make a copy of the file you want to rename and copy the content
in the new file and then delete the older file 

or If you want to rename the same file name you can use modules like "os module"
or "SH util module"
